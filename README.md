# Binary Image Detection

This project focuses on detecting and classifying binary images using computer vision techniques. It demonstrates the process of loading binary images, preprocessing them, and applying classification algorithms to distinguish between different categories.

## 🧠 Overview

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the steps of:

- Loading binary images from a dataset.
- Preprocessing images for analysis.
- Applying classification algorithms to detect patterns.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Image_recognition.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations.
- `images/`: Directory containing sample binary images used for testing and demonstration.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/minhkhoiine/Binary_image_detection.git
   cd Binary_image_detection
